## melody-ionic-cordova
`Melody` is an app template created with [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/)
###
Ionic is an open source mobile UI toolkit for building high quality, cross-platform native and web app experiences.

## First install the Ionic CLI:
You should make sure that your computer has the lattest version of Node.js installed, before you continue.
You can get Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
### 
Install the Ionic CLI with npm:
```npm
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```
## Clone Melody repository:
```git
git clone https://github.com/diina-gh/Melody/
```
If you don't have `git`, you can get it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
## Start the project:
```npm
cd Melody
ionic serve
```
The command `ionic serve` will start a live-reload server for your project in a web browser. When changes are made to any HTML, SASS, or TypeScript files, the browser will automatically reload.
## Cordova
With Cordova, you can test right in a simulator or use your own phone. To set up and run the app on your phone, use the following commands:
```npm
ionic cordova platform add android
```
###
Then:
```npm
ionic cordova run android --device
```
Note that your phone and your computer must be connected via a USB port.
